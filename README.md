#Character Creation is the Whole Game

Anyone want to help me polish a 48-hour game development/prototype game that got a bit out of hand?

It's called "**Character Creation is the Whole Game**" and the idea was: what if the whole game took place in a classic 8/16-bit style character creation screen?

When you spend one of your allocated points, your character ages and automatically experiences the adventures that in life might have resulted in greater strength, wisdom or skill. Random events take place -- dungeon plunges and hauls.  Stat choices would lead down different paths of life: with clever balancing to epic jobs and rewards, and mediocrity to those who dumbly max or spreading . And eventually you die or retire or become King.

I've got it to a playable point, but it needs a lot of tweaking and balancing.

It's coded as plain HTML and javascript, using the DOM as the engine. It will run offline, but it needs to be accessed from a webserver for the color picker to work on the character-design part.

The remaining problems with it are as follows:

1. The paths from rags to riches are just a tangled, unbalanced mess. It's sort of fun, but there's not much feeling of a unique inexporable fated journey through life. 

2. I can't decide if the pop-up "want this job?" things should even exist. I kind of suspect that they should be determined by your choices and just play out in the normal text box. So the only thing you ever do is click to raise and lower stats.

3. It Needs lots of little pixel art pics for the various stories and options that pop up.

Thanks for playing!
